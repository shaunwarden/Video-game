            <h2>Video-Gaming Platforms</h2>
            <p>
              It has been shown that action video game players have better hand–eye coordination and visuo-motor skills, such as their resistance to distraction, their sensitivity to information in the peripheral vision and their ability to count
              briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games
              requiring concentration on single objects. It has been suggested by a few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns.</p>

            <p>In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as
              well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by
              many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the
              process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the
              player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books.Some research suggests video games
              may even increase players' attention capacities.</p>

            <p>Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system.It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration,
              they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits.Students are found to be "learning by doing" while playing video games while fostering creative
              thinking.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Army has deployed machines such as the PackBot and UAV vehicles, which make use of a game-style hand controller to make it more familiar for young people.According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American
              Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' dexterity as well as their ability to do problem solving. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster
              at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video
              games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.</p>

            <p>An experiment carried out by Richard De Lisi and Jennifer Woldorf demonstrates the positive effect that video games may have on spatial skills. De Lisi and Woldorf took two groups of third graders, one control group and one experiment
              group. Both groups took a paper-and-pencil test of mental rotation skills. After this test, the experiment group only played 11 sessions of the game Tetris. This game was chosen as it requires mental rotation. After this game, both
              groups took the test again. The result showed that the scores of the experiment group raised higher than that of the control group, thereby confirming this theory.</p>

            <p>The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control
              groups.In addition, many of the studies are cross-sectional, and of the longitudinal interventional trials, not all have found effects.[86] A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than
              predicted, such as mental rotation, which is not a common task in action games.Action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions, but also at focusing on the main task.</p>

            <h3>Obejections to Video Games</h3>
            <p>
              Like other media, such as rock music (notably heavy metal music and gangsta rap), video games have been the subject of objections, controversies and censorship, for instance because of depictions of violence, criminal activities, sexual
              themes, alcohol, tobacco and other drugs, propaganda, profanity or advertisements. Critics of video games include parents' groups, politicians, religious groups, scientists and other advocacy groups. Claims that some video games cause
              addiction or violent behavior continue to be made and to be disputed.</p>

            <p>There have been a number of societal and scientific arguments about whether the content of video games change the behavior and attitudes of a player, and whether this is reflected in video game culture overall. Since the early 1980s,
              advocates of video games have emphasized their use as an expressive medium, arguing for their protection under the laws governing freedom of speech and also as an educational tool. Detractors argue that video games are harmful and
              therefore should be subject to legislative oversight and restrictions. The positive and negative characteristics and effects of video games are the subject of scientific study. Results of investigations into links between video games
              and addiction, aggression, violence, social development, and a variety of stereotyping and sexual morality issues are debated.A study was done that showed that young people who have had a greater exposure to violence in video games
              ended up behaving more aggressively towards people in a social environment.</p>

            <p>In 2018, the World Health Organization declared "gaming disorder" a mental disorder for people who are addicted to video games.Studies have shown video games can negatively effect health and mental state for some players.</p>

            <h3>Possible Benefits</h3>
            <p>
              In spite of the negative effects of video games, certain studies indicate that they may have value in terms of academic performance, perhaps because of the skills that are developed in the process. “When you play ... games you’re
              solving puzzles to move to the next level and that involves using some of the general knowledge and skills in maths, reading and science that you’ve been taught during the day,” said Alberto Posso an Associate Professor at the Royal
              Melbourne Institute of Technology, after analysing data from the results of standardized testing completed by over 12,000 high school students across Australia. As summarized by The Guardian,the study (published in the International
              Journal of Communication) "found that students who played online games almost every day scored 15 points above average in maths and reading tests and 17 points above average in science." However, the reporter added an important comment
              that was not provided by some of the numerous Web sites that published a brief summary of the Australian study: "[the] methodology cannot prove that playing video games were the cause of the improvement." The Guardian also reported that
              a Columbia University study indicated that extensive video gaming by students in the 6 to 11 age group provided a greatly increased chance of high intellectual functioning and overall school competence.
            </p>

            <p>In an interview with CNN, Edward Castronova, a professor of Telecommunications at Indiana University Bloomington said he was not surprised by the outcome of the Australian study but also discussed the issue of causal connection.
              "Though there is a link between gaming and higher math and science scores, it doesn't mean playing games caused the higher scores. It could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for a challenge, and they don't find it on social
              media, and maybe they do find it on board games and video games," he explained.</p>

            <p>Video games have also been proven to raise self-esteem and build confidence. It gives people an opportunity to do things that they cannot do offline, and to discover new things about themselves. There is a social aspect to gaming as
              well – research has shown that a third of video game players make good friends online. As well as that, video games are also considered to be therapeutic as it helps to relieve stress. Although short term, studies have shown that
              children with developmental delays gain a temporary physical improvement in health when they interact and play video games on a regular, and consistent basis due to the cognitive benefits and the use of hand eye coordination.</p>

            <h3>Self Determination Theory</h3>
            <p>
              Self-determination theory (SDT) is a macro theory of human motivation based around competence, autonomy, and relatedness to facilitate positive outcomes.SDT provides a framework for understanding the effects of playing video games;
              well-being, problem solving, group relations, physical activities.These factors can be measured to determine the effect video games can have on people.

            <p>
              The ability to create an ideal image of one's self and being given multiple options to change that image gives a sense of satisfaction. This topic has much controversy; it is unknown whether this freedom can be beneficial to one's
              character or detrimental. With increased game usage, a player can become too invested in a fictionally generated character, where the desire to look that way overpowers the enjoyment of the game.[102] Players see this character creation
              as entertainment and a release, creating a self-image they could not obtain in reality, bringing comfort outside of the game from lack of investment to the fictional character. Problems that arise based on character design may be link
              to personality disorders.

        <!-- Problem Solving Text -->
        <h3>Problem Solving Skills</h3>
        <p>
          Cognitive skills can be enhanced through repetition of puzzles, memory games, spatial abilities and attention control.Most video games present opportunities to use these skills with the ability to try multiple times even
          after failure. Many of these skills can be translated to reality and problem solving. This allows the player to learn from mistakes and fully understand how and why a solution to a problem may work. Some researchers believe that continual
          exposure to challenges may lead players to develop greater persistence over time after a study was shown that frequent players spent more time on puzzles in task that did not involve video games.[100][101] Although players were shown to
          spend more time on puzzles, much of that could have been due to the positive effects of problem solving in games, which involve forming strategy and weighing option before testing a solution.
        </p>

        <p>Representatives of Game Academy claim that such games as Civilization, Total War, or X-Com, where strategy and resource management are key, help players to develop skills that are of great use to managers. Also, they found out that IT
          workers play unusual puzzle games like Portal or tower defense games like Defense Grid more often than specialists from other fields.</p>

        <p>In a study that followed students through school, students that played video games showed higher levels of problem solving than students who did not.[100] This contradicts the previous study in that higher success rate was seen in video
          game players. Time being a factor for problem solving led to different conclusions in the different studies. See video game controversies for more.</p>

        <p>
          Online gaming being on the rise allows for video game players to communicate and work together in order to accomplish a certain task. Being able to work as a group in a game translates well to reality and jobs, where people must work
          together to accomplish a task. Research on players in violent and non-violent games show similar results, where the players relations improved to improve synergy

        <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual reality (VR) games generally require players to use a special head-mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR
          systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted
          unit.
