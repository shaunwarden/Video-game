            <h2>Casual Games</h2>
            <p>
              Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as
              a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Examples of genres within
              this category are match three, hidden object, time management, puzzle or many of the tower defense style games. Casual games are generally available through app stores and online retailers such as PopCap, Zylom and GameHouse or provided
              for free play through web portals such as Newgrounds. While casual games are most commonly played on personal computers, phones or tablets, they can also be found on many of the on-line console system download services (e.g., the
              PlayStation Network, WiiWare or Xbox Live).

            <h3>Serious Games</h3>
            <p>
              Serious games are games that are designed primarily to convey information or a learning experience to the player. Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software
              does not typically fall under this category (e.g., touch typing tutors, language learning programs, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the game's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the
              other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule. Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although
              some such as exercise games, educational games, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job
              or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.
            </p>
            <p>One of the longest-running serious games franchises is Microsoft Flight Simulator, first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses virtual reality-based simulations, such as VBS1 for training exercises,as do a
              growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, firefighters, EMTs).One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of Second Life, which is currently used by
              several United States governmental departments (e.g., NOAA, NASA, JPL), Universities (e.g., Ohio University, MIT) for educational and remote learning programsand businesses (e.g., IBM, Cisco Systems) for meetings and training.</p>
            <p>Tactical media in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information
              that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be newsgames. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point.For example, Take Action Games is a
              game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include Darfur is Dying, Finding Zoe, and In The Balance. All of these games bring awareness to important issues and
              events.</p>

            <h3>Educational Games</h3>
            <p>
              On 23 September 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama launched a campaign called "Educate to Innovate" aimed at improving the technological, mathematical, scientific and engineering abilities of American students. This campaign states that
              it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments.[39][40] This campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many
              new competitions. Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the Imagine Cup.[41][42] Both of these bring a focus to relevant and important current issues through gaming. www.NobelPrize.org entices
              the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun video game.[43] There are many different types and styles of educational games, including counting to spelling to games for kids, to
              games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.
